# EDirect
Contains Basic Code to Utilize EDirect to Query Pubmed

This repository contains code to be implemented when using EDirect for pubMed.  This includes code to achieve the following: initialize eDirect, run a basic search command, run a basic fetch command to get abstracts, utilize xtract to get out volume and issue of a journal, create a txt file of pmid’s, return funding results from both a list of PMID’s and from piping in the results of a search, put any results into an excel file, return an organized list of all chemical names in excel format given a list of PMID’s,  and return an organized list of all keywords (which usually includes the condition and treatment) in excel format given a list of PMID’s.
